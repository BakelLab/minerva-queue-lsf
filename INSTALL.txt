# INSTALLATION NOTES #
######################

1. Get the most recent version of the minerva queue utilities from Bitbucket:

      git clone git@bitbucket.org:hvbakel/minerva-queue.git

2. Add the 'bin' directory with the queue script to your PATH environment
   variable. For example if you downloaded the files to ~/opt, add the following
   to your ~/.bashrc file:
   
      export PATH="$PATH:~/opt/minerva-queue/bin"

3. Copy the torque prologue and epilogue scripts to your home directory as
   hidden files so that they will be automatically picked up by the submitjob
   script (note, symlinks will *not* work).
   
      cp torque/torque.epilogue.sh ~/.torque.epilogue.sh
      cp torque/torque.prologue.sh ~/.torque.prologue.sh

   Set permissions to 700, otherwise the queueuing system will ignore them:
   
      chmod 700 ~/.torque.epilogue.sh
      chmod 700 ~/.torque.prologue.sh

   Note that submitjob will work without the prologue and epilogue scripts,
   but installing them adds functionality, such as a job-specific shared 
   memory folder that can be used to save temporary files in memory
   rather than on disk. The folder location is exposed through the TMPSHMDIR
   environment variable and it will be deleted automatically when upon completion
   of the job, ensuring that no files are left behind.


Be sure to periodically run 'git pull' in the minerva-queue directory as the
code is updated frequently to stay up to date with the latest queue changes
and to add new features.
